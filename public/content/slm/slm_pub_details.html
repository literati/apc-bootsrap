<p>The owner of the <em>Messenger</em>, Thomas Willis White, dismissed his assistant, Edgar A. Poe on January 3, after Poe had written most of the reviews for the January issue and had provisionally arranged the contents. White was, however, still discussing with Poe on January 17 how much of his “Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym” could be included in the January issue (<em>Poe Log</em> 239). In assuming Poe’s duties, White was thus obliged to work directly with the printer to manage page layout and spacing--which may have contributed to the delay. The March issue of 1837 was the first to identify White officially as editor and proprietor.</p>
