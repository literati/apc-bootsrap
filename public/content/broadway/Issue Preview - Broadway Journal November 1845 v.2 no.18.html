<p><strong>Commentary<em>*</strong>:</em>* </p>

<p>This issue includes Poe’s revised "The Devil in the Belfry," a tale that recalls Washington Irving’s* History of New-York* and the persona of Diedrich Knickerbocker.  Poe’s tale opens in the Dutch borough of Vondervotteimittiss and the language as well as the plot poke fun at the rigidity of Pennsylvania Dutch or German (Deutsch) cultural practices.  The tale evokes Irving’s satires of the Dutch but seems more an <em>homage</em> than a parody. The story originally appeared in the (Philadelphia) <em>Saturday Chronicle and Mirror of the Times</em> in on May 18th, 1839.  Poe also uses the reviews section of this week’s issue to wholly dismiss the November issue of the* Knickerbocker Magazine* as both “beneath notice and beneath contempt.”</p>
